    <h1>Getting the WWW files</h1>
    <p>Read this if you have not yet got the WWW files you need, and you cannot NFS mount a directory on which they reside.</p>
    <p>The source and binary of WWW project files are currently available (see copyright ) by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch. This node is currently 128.141.201.74 but THIS MAY CHANGE. The files are compressed tape archive files (.tar.Z). To get a file using anonymous FTP, use user name "anonymous", and your email address as a password:-</p>
    <p>
        > ftp info.cern.ch
        Enter user name: anonymous
        Password: me@myhost.edu
        ftp> cd /pub/www/src
        ftp> binary
        ftp> get WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z
        ftp> quit
        >
    </p>
    <p>The file name will depend on the product you want. Here vvv is the version number of the software.</p>
    <p>Once you have the compressed tar file, you must uncompress it and unwrap it.</p>
    <p>
        uncompress WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z
    </p>    
    <p>This will make a rather larger file with the name without the ".Z". To unwrap it,</p>
    <p>
        tar xvf WWWLineMode_vvv.tar
    </p>
    <p>Now you should install the line mode browser , install the server , install Viola , etc.</p>
